      "[OpenMP](http://www.openmp.org/) is an interface for C/C++/Fortran to direct multithreaded, shared-memory parallel execution.  OpenMP allows a group of processors to co\u00f6rdinate work between themselves using the _fork\u2013join_ model of parallelism.  In this model, a _master_ thread (or process) spawns groups of _slave_ threads as appropriate to solve certain calculations.\n",

The _problem_ with this RNG, as I mentioned before, is that it is not _thread safe_.

However, as the number of terms in the series increases, there is a crossover point and parallel computation becomes more efficient from a _wall time_ perspective.  (That is, for time as we observe it.  In processor time, the total time spent on the calculation should be multiplied by the number of processes involved.)\n",

      "Now this may be kind of a funny aside, but it is a concern I often had as a student.  MPI owes a lot to the local computer science and parallel programming folks on campus, so is it just a tool we prefer because it is \"in-house\"?  There are tools that get talked about a lot, as well as advanced research projects that offer interesting features but are not widely adopted, like [CHARM++](http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/) or [UPC](http://upc.lbl.gov/).  No, MPI is used everywhere and really is the standard for supercomputing today.\n",

      "The best parallel algorithm is oten not the best sequential algorithm.  For instance, in matrix solution, we can select from Jacobi relaxation or Gauss\u2013Seidel relaxation.  [Jacobi relaxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method) is a na\u00efve algorithm to solve a matrix equation iteratively by inverting only the diagonal elements and modifying an initial guess progressively until a solution within certain tolerances is found.  [Gauss\u2013Seidel relaxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method) is formally a better algorithm, since it also takes advantage of updated data points from _the current iteration_ to improve the subsequent data points in-flight as well.  However, Jacobi relaxation, relying exclusively on a prior iteration, can be sensibly implemented in parallel while Gauss\u2013Seidel iteration can not.\n",
